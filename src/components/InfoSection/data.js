Initially renting a space to service and customize their own bikes, they used past experience with car builds along with inspiration from custom bikes from around the world and decided to offer their services to the expats and locals. What set them apart was not only the most original and badass bikes of Hanoi, but also the honesty and quality that came with them, a rarity in Vietnam.",
